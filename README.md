# React Hangman Game

Welcome to the React Hangman Game! This project is a fun and interactive implementation of the classic word-guessing game, built using React and Vite.

## About the Game

Hangman is a simple yet engaging game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. Each incorrect guess brings the player closer to "hanging" the stick figure. The goal is to guess the word before running out of attempts.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Enjoy a smooth and responsive gaming experience powered by React.
- **Dynamic Word Selection**: Words are randomly chosen to keep the game fresh and challenging.
- **Visual Feedback**: Watch the stick figure evolve with each incorrect guess.
- **Keyboard Support**: Guess letters using your keyboard for a seamless experience.

## How to Play

1. Start the game to reveal the blank spaces representing the hidden word.
2. Guess a letter by clicking on it or typing it on your keyboard.
3. Correct guesses fill in the blanks, while incorrect guesses add parts to the stick figure.
4. Win by guessing the word before the stick figure is fully drawn!
